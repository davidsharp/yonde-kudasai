# yonde(hanashite) kudasai!

This is a WIP Chrome extension that reads some Japanese

### To use:
This is in no way really any use, but if you want to give it a go, pull the repo open `chrome://extensions` and then `Load unpacked extension...`.

To _actually_ use it, highlight a word or kanji and then press <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+Y</kbd>. Alternatively, you can also type `yonde` into your address bar, hit space and then type your word.
