# JISHO ME!

This is a WIP Chrome extension that pulls information from Jisho.org based on highlighted text.

### To use:
This is in no way really any use, but if you want to give it a go, pull the repo open `chrome://extensions` and then `Load unpacked extension...`. From here, you can open the background page, where logging and Jisho results will appear in the console.

To _actually_ use it, highlight a word or kanji and then press <kbd>Command+Shift+A</kbd> (on Mac) or <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+A</kbd> (on PC/Linux). Alternatively, you can also type `jisho` into your address bar, hit space and then type your word.

It currently doesn't handle multiple words, or tags or anything that would be particularly useful. But it also makes similar mistakes to other extensions available, which for now is fine by me.
